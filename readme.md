# My project

## Instructions for the calculator located in the project folder:
1. Clone this folder to yourself
2. After going to this folder, enter 
```bash
g++ BigInt.cpp Complex.cpp calculatorgrigory.cpp -o calculator
```
3. Then open the calculator
```bash
./calculator.exe
```
4. Enjoy what an incredible calculator it is!

## Additionally:
The BIgInt calculator is activated if there are no floating point numbers and imaginary ones in the input string. 
The BigInt calculator has hexadecimal input and output.
When you finish entering expressions, press enter, the calculator will close.
if you want to change the logic of the calculators (for example, input 1 for Complex and input 2 for BigInt), change the file calculatorgrigory.cpp
